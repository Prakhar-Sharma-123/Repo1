a) Hello. I am Prakhar Sharma from Delhi. I am a first year student at IIT Madras.
My hobbies include singing, playing the keyboard, and also playing badminton.


b) I like that using Git we can maintain multiple versions of our project (version control) which allows us to switch back to an older version after trying out some changes.


c) I enjoyed the python assignment problem where we had to plot the time v/s input size graph using matplotlib for linear search and binary search. It was a fun exercise and I learnt a lot of new things.
